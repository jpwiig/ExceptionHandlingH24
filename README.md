# ExceptionHandlingH24

This Github repository is meant as a demo for exception handling during the fall 24 pratice at OsloMet. You are free to do whatever you want with the code, but this is mainly for teaching purpouses. 

## Structure of this repository

The main branch will be updated with the finished code **AFTER** the final lab with the finished code. 

There are mainly two different branches in the project, theese will show the live coding in the different times, as the two demo holder as a bit different coding style we will demonstrate in somewhat different ways. 


### Here is a quick overveiw:
