/* We have an assignment. We are going to make a small program used in a productivity analysis for Foodora.
Foodora is interested in finding out how much time their delivery people use on travel, per delivery. Each delivery
has an attached invoice for travel costs using Voi electric scooters. Voi's cost is 3 kr per minute of use, and always
rounds up to the nearest full minute. Our program will take the invoice price and cost per minute as inputs from
the user, and output the length of the ride in minutes.
